# WebLobby
A RESTful web service providing the ability to create and manage a virtual "waiting rooms"

WebLobby provides a backend service to create a "waiting room" in your application.  Say you have some process that is particulalry taxing on your system that a high volume of users are attempting to do at the same time.  A good example of this would be when a new product you sell on a web site is first made available for sale.  If it is an in demand product, you could potentially have more users on your site attempting to purchase the product than your application is capable of handling.  This could result in your application crashing due to the load and a lot of unhappy users.
